I can't share the source code of the actual project, but this is a simple demo that explains what I'm trying to achieve.

## The Challenge

In the index.css file, I have an "active" class that changes the style of a nav link when clicked. This nav link takes us to a particular section on the page.

Now, if we scroll to a different section, I want to put the "active" class on the nav link that corresponds to the current section in view.

Please help!
